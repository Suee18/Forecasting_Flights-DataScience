Now I have examined all your preprocessing notebooks. I can see that you've already created a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline with:

Base Preprocessing Pipeline: Common cleaning and feature engineering for all model types
ML Preprocessing Pipeline: Features optimized for traditional ML models
Deep Learning Preprocessing Pipeline: Features optimized for neural networks and embedding layers
Time Series Preprocessing Pipeline: Features optimized for time series forecasting models
The pipelines are well-structured, handle data in chunks for memory efficiency, and each tackles specialized tasks specific to their model requirements.

Let me summarize what's already implemented across these pipelines:
Data cleaning and type conversions
Missing value handling with appropriate strategies
Feature derivation (date/time features, etc.)
Filtering out 2020 data due to COVID-19 irregularities


ML Preprocessing:
ML-specific feature engineering (route features, cyclical encodings, interaction features)
Outlier treatment via winsorization
Categorical encoding (one-hot, ordinal)
Feature selection based on correlation
Normalization/scaling
Time-based train-test splitting


DL Preprocessing:Features optimized for neural networks
Label encoding for embedding layers
Data normalization
Sequence generation for RNNs/LSTMs
Batch creation for deep learning frameworks


Time Series Preprocessing:
Temporal aggregation (daily, airport, carrier)
Time series feature engineering (lags, rolling windows)
Seasonality analysis and handling
Stationarity testing and transformations
Time-based cross-validation
Data formatting for various time series algorithms


All the pipelines you requested are already in place
 and well-implemented. They follow best practices for
  each model type and include appropriate handling of 
  the specific challenges like the COVID-19 data filtering 
  you mentioned.

The duplicate detection is based on a combination of key flight identifiers:
Flight date
Carrier and flight number
Origin and destination airports
Departure time (either actual or scheduled)
This implementation will now detect and remove duplicate flight records in the base preprocessing pipeline, which will benefit all model types since this cleansing is applied at the beginning of the pipeline.
